A file with .txt extension represents a text document that contains plain text in the form of lines. Paragraphs in a text document are recognized by carriage returns and are use for better arrangements of file contents. A standard text document can be opened in any text editor or word processing application on different operating systems. All the text contained in such a file is in human-readable format and represented by sequence of characters.

Text files can store large amount of data as there is no limitation on the size of contents. However, text editors opening such a large files need to be smart for loading and displaying these. Almost all operating systems come with text editors that allow you to create and edit text files. For example, Windows OS comes with Notepad and Wordpad for this purpose. Similarly, MacOS comes with TextEdit for creating and editing Text Documents.

Each user implied line is defined by combination of two characters i.e. carriage return \(CR\) and Line Feed \(LF\). Windows text files can be in ANSI, OEM, Unicode or UTF-8 encoding. The UTF-16 encoding helps save information in a text file that requires two bytes for representation. Such files usually begin with Byte Order Mark \(BOM\) which communicates the endianness of the file content. It should be noted that other applications on Windows OS can store information in text file format but with different files extensions to represent application specific text. For example, programming languages usually save code in text file but with their own extensions.
