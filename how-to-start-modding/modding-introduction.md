# Modding introduction

## First step

Before getting into Titanfall 2 modding, you should backup any VPK files that you will get into, if you mess up or your VPK files get corrupted you don't need to download or repair your game from Origin because you will learn how to make a backup

{% hint style="info" %}
In this guide, the location of each VPK file will be listed at the beginning of the page.
{% endhint %}

This Gitbook repo will be updated over time as we get new information about what's possible around Titanfall 2 modding. You can check the [NoSkill Community Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/sEgmTKg) where update notifications are posted each time new content is added to the wiki. Join our Discord server to say hi, ask questions, report typos, mistakes or ask to contribute to the wiki.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Discord server **is not a support server for vpk modding**.
{% endhint %}

## Notes

As a side note, in this wiki we will refer to some tools to do certain processes. Check out the "[Modding tools](https://noskill.gitbook.io/titanfall2/how-to-start-modding/modding-tools)" page. This page is linked to anyways when tools are mentioned in other guides.
